Dear Flora,

You have just turned a month since you were born.  Mom and I have also thus progressed through a month of parenthood.  While it has been challenging, it has been the most rewarding experience in our lives, while we see you _grow__ and change every day.

You have grown with vigor and health, every day the more beautiful.  I see a lot of myself in you, as you constantly gaze and wonder in your thoughts.  I see a lot of your Mom in you, as you reflect a temperament of good being.  I cannot wait for what your future brings, but right now, I am living in an _Eternal Now_, a moment that feels like eternity as one does not ponder of the past nor worry about the future, but is living fully in the present, in your very presence.

Love,

Dad
