# Gardens

I started gardening around 2022 in the comfort of my backyard.

I discovered many of the following thoughts through gardening and they continue to influence the way I think and live.

These loose thoughts are not organized in any specific order or flow.

---

> One is nearer God's heart in a garden than anywhere else on earth.
-- <cite>Dorothy Frances Gurney</cite>

- The word *God* is left as an open interpretation e.g. *God*, *Nature*, *Universe*, *Self*, *Truth*, *Beauty*
- The word *garden* is left as an open interpretation e.g. *world*, *life*, *system*.
- Gardens are at the heart of many spiritual teachings e.g. *The Garden of Eden* in the Bible, *The Seeds of the Mind* in Buddhism.

---

> The main elements of gardening: plants, water, sunlight, time, the gardener.

- A garden involves a closed system of plants, an open system of water/sunlight, and develops over time, under the care of the gardener.

---

> Seek to forge, and not force.

- If one seeks to force a look for their garden, one will only be disappointed as the garden inevitably changes over time.
- A forced garden is unnatural while a forged garden is natural.
- One needs to adapt and forge the garden based on changing conditions instead of being forced to keep the garden based on initial conditions.

---

> Focus on conditions, not on casuality.

- Causality is a powerful mode of thinking, but it is only effective in closed systems.
- When a system is no longer closed, arguments of casuality fail and arguments of conditions become more powerful e.g. *"This tree is unable to grow because the conditions are not ideal (e.g. climate, water, sunlight).  When conditions become ideal, the tree grows."*

---

> The state of a tree reflects its history of conditions.

- A healthy tree under good conditions grows tall with rich foilage.
- A struggling tree under poor conditions grows thin with few leaves.
- A pruned tree under varying conditions grows based on the actions of the gardener.

---

> The trees will outlive you.

- This is a powerful insight if your point of view of lifecycles is different e.g. *Trees are long-lived and the garden you create will outlive you*.

---

> The weeds will outlive you.

- Weeds are short-lived but the recurrence of weeds is eternal.
- Every year, thousands of buried weed seeds re-energize and thousands of new wind-swept weed seeds are brought into the garden.
- Instead of attempting to kill the problem, you accept and deal with it as part of life.

---

> The garden reflects a balance of energy.  The gardener is the balancer.

- Weeds represent negative energy, eagerly ready to overpower the garden.
- Flowers and trees represent positive energy.
- The gardener balances the energy of the garden, by expending one's own energy, to deal with negative-energy weeds while growing positive-energy plants in their place.
---

> The weed is the flower, and the flower is the weed.

- When weeds die, they become soil and nutrients for other plants to grow.
- When other plants die, they create opportunities for weeds to set in.
- Problems are a source of opportunities and opportunities can degrade to problems.

---

> There is a cycle and order to everything.

- Understand the cycles to understand its blessings and curses.
- When there is heavy rain, mosquitos begin their life cycle.  They disappear when the garden dries up.
- When there is new sod and rain, earthworms and beetles spring to life.  Their castings fuel the health of plants.  They die fast when the garden dries up.
- When bugs multiply, you will notice birds visiting the garden.  They sing and leave when the bugs dwindle.
- The cycles occur with or without the gardener's presence.

---

> The garden is not a closed system.

- It is common to initially create a garden as a closed system of plants.
- The garden is exposed to an open system i.e. *Nature*.  This system brings both positive energies (rain, sunlight) and negative energies (weed seeds).

---

> The garden itself is meaningless, and it is given meaning through the process of gardening.

- A garden is objectively a closed system of plants.  It exists with or without observers.
- The gardening process involves meaningfully tending to the closed system, with subjective decisions performed by the gardener.

---

> *Nature* is the silent teacher when the gardener is eager to learn.

- Trees and plants do not speak, smile, or feel.
- Yet all these personal thoughts are formed by observing *Nature* while working in the garden, understanding the *nature of things* and why things work or fail, and drawing parallel lessons in live.

---

> A garden is a stabilizing ecosystem.

- Things take time to settle and stabilize.
- A garden forges itself over time.  Plants grow denser.  Rocks are painted with dirt and moss.  Trees grow taller. Insects destroy or pollinate the garden.  Birds and animals settle in the garden.

---

> Life is everywhere.

- From the moss, to the grass, to the trees.
- From the aphlids, to the aphids, to the ants, to the spiders.
- From the dead matter, to the worms, to the bacteria.

---

> Wonderous beauty born from simplicity.

- From a single seed, a tree slowly grows needing just water and sunlight.
- From a single tree, an ecosystem of insects and birds spring up.
---

> The gardener shapes the garden and the garden shapes the gardener.

- Most people understand that a gardener shapes the garden, but the evolving garden shapes the gardener's evolving thoughts and actions.

---

> *Nature* is both *the Garden* and *the Gardener*.

- A garden is a closed system open to *Nature*, being shaped by a gardener.
- *Nature* is the enclosing open system and is both *the Garden* of gardens, and is *the Gardener* that tends to itself and provides for all other gardens.

When you impact your surroundings naturally, you are one with Nature.  Just as the bees and butterflies that go about their search for nectar, as do the ants that march for food and tunnel as they build their world, as the roots of trees weave through this improved soil, their very natural and subconscious activities are essential elements in the broader expression of a living Nature.  Do not seek to build your surroundings, but instead forge yourself naturally with your actions that inevitably shape the Natural world around you.

The Sun rises, and the ants begin their march, as does Man begins his/her march along. The march changes over the years, as the cars and planes join in.  But as do all marches, we all leave a trail that influences the world around us.  The ants tunnel as the soil aerates and fills in with the roots of plants.  We carve roads and landscapes and terraform a concrete jungle, at times leaving no room for other life to fill in, but almost certainly life fills itself in as weeds and moss and mold finds a way in the concrete cracks, as Nature marches on Herself in terraforming the landscape back. The march goes on, as the Universe observes which march expresses itself in the most beautiful forms, not an end-form, but simply the expressions over a period of time on an infinite timeline.
