# *Manifesting*

Meditations on unforming notions of birth, death, rebirth, eternity.  Everything "exists".  Everything only manifests if conditions are right.

What will become, is not because what it was, and what it should be, but because of what it is, where the "is" is shaped by experiential unconsciousess.  Where else on the other hand, it "was" and "will", is shapped by passive hypothetical consciousness.

True consciousness is not simply the focused consciousness and will of the individual, but rather, the overall conscioussness of the individual in harmony with the will outside of the individual (i.e. of everyone, of God, of the Universe).
