# *Manifesting*

Meditations on unforming notions of birth, death, rebirth, eternity.  Everything "exists".  Everything only manifests if conditions are right.

What will become, is not because what it was, but because of what it is, where the "is" is shaped by experiential unconsciousess.  Where it "was" and "will", is shapped by passive hypothetical consciousness.
