## A *Natural* Scene

I stand before a lake staring at my reflection trying to capture the natural scene before me with my camera.

The lake reflects the crane flying above it, capturing its beauty momentarily.  A missed opportunity for my camera.

The lake continues to reflect the air, mountains, and trees.  With regrets, I leave with a photograph of myself and the lake, with its air, mountains, and trees.

Some years later and I am back at the lake carrying the old photograph with me.  With past regrets, I am determined to capture a wonderous natural scene.

As I look at the photograph and the scene carefully, I noticed that it no longer reflects the scene before me.  The water, air, mountains, and trees are still there but shifted in overall position and shape.

On initial thinking, I obviously understand that the water, air, mountains, and trees have shifted their energies over the years.  I understand that the water turns to air, the air blows through the mountains, the water and air nourishes the trees, and the trees break down into mountains and air.

On mindful thinking, I realize that the water is the air is the tree is the mountain.  The air is the water is the tree is the mountain...  Everything is contained in everything.  The natural cycle of change has been and always will be there.

I put my camera down and step into the lake.  With the *Natural* scene contained in my being, my being is now contained in it.  I am the water, the air, the tree, and the mountain.  My past regrets transform into peace and joy.

Somewhere in the distance, an unmindful person with a camera arrives to the lake and leaves with immediate regret seeing a man swimming in the lake.

Somewhere else in the distance, a mindful person without a camera arrives to the lake and witnesses a *Natural* scene and smiles.

The lake reflects a man swimming in it, capturing his happiness perpetually.

The lake continues to reflect the air, mountains, and trees.
