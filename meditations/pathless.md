# Pathless

While many paths lead to insight, *True Insight* is realizing that it *is* the path.

*Aimlessness* is at the core of these meditations.

> There is no path to happiness.  *Happiness* is the path.

> There is no path to enlightenment.  *Enlightenment* is the path.

> There is no path to understanding.  *Understanding* is the path.

> There is no path to salvation.  *Salvation* is the path.
