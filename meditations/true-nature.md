# *True Nature*

Meditations on seeing beyond relative symbols formed in the metaverses and into the *True Nature* of the *Universe*.  *True Nature* lies beyond concepts and can only be experienced.

> This (Happiness/Love/I/etc) is not "this", therefore it is truly *this*.

> The ripples in the lake look peaceful. The lake is peaceful.

> When you touch the wave, you touch the water.

> When you live mindfully in the moment, you become the moment and the moment becomes you.

> I dwell in *This (God/Love/Peace/Universe/etc)* and hence *This* dwells in me.

> The symboless world is the wonderous reality of *Nature*.
