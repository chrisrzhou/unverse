> The Universe experiences itself through me, you, and all of itself.
> You experience yourself through you, me, and all of the Universe.
> I experience myself through me, you, and all of the Universe.

> The experience (and memory) of the Universe is the universal experience (and memory) of all conscious beings.

> Everything is layered.  Your existence is layered on past generations, and the trust that that very infrasturcture is dependable.  We build over rotting wood, decomposing concrete, but the world is held in a forward path because of the trust and understanding and maintenance of that infrasturcture.  As our world cannot exist without the layered existence that enables life in the Universe, we cannot truly evolve the world without this understanding, as we are increasingly layering above the Universe, without a conscious understanding of what that means. When one understands this, one can build layers irregardless of how the world is trending, as the faith that every layered experience yields the next successful experience, and therefore generations.
