# Ozymandias

## Reflections

### Common interpretations
Ozymandias is commonly interpreted as a poem that outlines the impermanent nature of power and achievement, all of which, is lost through time.  One can draw deeper reflections about what it means to "create history", and what history itself amounts to.  The literary, historical, and political interpretations of the poem can be further researched on the internet.  The next section captures personal interpretations of the poem.  

### Personal interpretations
This poem is both foreign and familiar to me.  I do not recall reading or studying the poem in my life, but it generates strong feelings when I read and revisit it.  Here are some additional personal interpretations:

> I met a traveller from an antique land

The reader (*I*) is a traveller from an unfamiliar place and time era (*antique land*) encountering the story of Ozymandias.

> Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone

The best way to persist information is through stone (this is true even in the age of digital information).  The king of kings understood this and wished to persist his image as a stone statue, but yet only the legs remain "standing" over the course of time.

> Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,

The face is the only way to represent an individual clearly and uniquely.  The face of the king of kings is no longer in its intended recognizable place, and potentially will be sunk further and lost through time if not discovered.

> Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,

The personification of a once living king is at best lifeless (a stone statue).  And something that is lifeless seems also to be struggling to *survive* over the course of time.

> And on the pedestal these words appear:

Whilst the image of the king is seemingly lost, the message is still clear.

> "My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:

Whilst the message is clear, the traveller still has no context who Ozymandias is, and this is further emphasized that he is just a "king of kings" and not a "King of kings", barren of context and relevance of any achievement that has occured in history.

> "Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!"

And as the next line of the poem yields an emotional contradiction to the bold message,

> Nothing beside remains. Round the decay

That there is nothing to despair, as there is nothing that remains.

> The lone and level sands stretch far away.

The traveller is left wondering how many other statues and messages remain or are lost through the ever-stretching sands of time.

### Key Interpretation

My key interpretation of the poem is:

> *The meaning of the poem _Ozymandias_ is encoded in the poem as a symbolic whole itself.  The meaning is only materialized by an observation.  _Ozymandias_ is a poem that dances between the concepts of physical vs abstract, living vs lifeless.*

Just as the initial "time traveller" encounters the statue of Ozymandias and attempts to derive meaning behind the visible clues that remain, the reader from a different land (culture/time) can only attempt to derive meaning behind the poem if the poem itself exists.  The poem _Ozymandias_ is as impermanent as the statue of Ozymandias.  If parts or the whole poem of _Ozymandias_ is lost as the statue of Ozymandias is lost in the poem, a traveller would draw different insights from the encounter.

_Ozymandias_ rewards the journeying traveller their insights upon observation.  The traveller deriving meaning from the partial statue of Ozymandias is similar to the traveller (reader) deriving meaning from the poem _Ozymandias_.  New knowledge and emotions are derived as part of the observation.  Without the traveller's observation, both statue of Ozymandias and poem of _Ozymandias_ are lifeless persisted records that fade in the sands of time.  But once observed, the lifeless records revivify the traveller's imagination and insight.
