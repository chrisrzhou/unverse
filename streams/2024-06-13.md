On your email to Tianwen, that is pretty much consistent with my fundamental personality.  As I am older and coding at work, I have the same exact mindset.  New ideas come to me, and I can code them into existence.

Remembering how I felt as a kid, I was probably disappointed that some ideas were already solved.  Remembering just a few years ago as an adult, I struggled with the same feelings of disappointment.

I now TRULY know how I feel in relation to my inner being and drive.  I still want to create and I keep creating (code, garden).  But I no longer feel disappointed if my idea is no longer “unique”, because the important part is simply following through with your idea and thought, and the experience of following through gives bigger rewards. Simply thinking about them doesn’t have much value.  If an idea has already been realized by others, it simply meant it was a great idea that is shared by the excitement of others, others who are even more excited about it that they took action.  Finally, all ideas have a time and place, and they are realized by everyone in the world.  The broader humanity reflects a peaceful consciousness and creativity when you think about the problem this way, vs only caring about the value of an idea personally (selfishly).

I think the above is something I mastered in life recently, and continue to master, as it gives me inner peace, but also allows me to develop my ideas in context of the world.
